As a B Corporation, our mission is to use advanced geospatial technology for civic, social, and environmental impact. Most of our work deals with local governments, non-profit organizations, and academic or federal research projects.  We build custom web applications, perform geospatial analysis, and contribute to open source projects.  Our engineers work across the technology stack, from modern browser-based front-ends to robust service-based backends residing on scalable infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>We are looking for a Software Engineer who is passionate about building and operating applications that will have a positive impact.

The GeoTrellis team develops an open source software framework that enables low latency, distributed processing of geospatial data; the majority of our work is currently funded by the U.S. Federal government. The project is based on Scala and Apache Spark. It is used in many types of web applications, including processing satellite imagery, climate change, precision agriculture, public transit travel-sheds, and watershed modeling. GeoTrellis is a member of the Eclipse Foundation\u2019s LocationTech working group.
